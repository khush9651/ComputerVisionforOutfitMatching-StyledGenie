# Computer Vision for Outfit Matching

## Overview

This project aims to develop a computer vision model capable of identifying and matching outfits based on clothing categories and color harmony. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system can suggest outfit combinations that complement each other, enhancing the fashion selection experience.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Categorizes clothing items (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes) using a deep learning model.
- **Color Detection Algorithm:** Identifies color harmony to suggest outfit matches.
- **Deep Learning Implementation:** Uses CNNs for accurate image classification.
- **Fashion Image Processing:** Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow/PyTorch for image analysis.
- **Report Generation:** Provides a summary of model accuracy and findings.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
