# Computer Vision for Outfit Matching

## Overview

This project aims to develop a computer vision model capable of identifying and matching outfits based on clothing categories and color harmony. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the system can suggest outfit combinations that complement each other, enhancing the fashion selection experience.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** Categorizes clothing items (e.g., tops, bottoms, shoes) using a deep learning model.
- **Color Detection Algorithm:** Identifies color harmony to suggest outfit matches.
- **Deep Learning Implementation:** Uses CNNs for accurate image classification.
- **Fashion Image Processing:** Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow/PyTorch for image analysis.
- **Report Generation:** Provides a summary of model accuracy and findings.
- **Real-Time Outfit Matching:** Supports real-time recommendations based on uploaded images.
- **Dataset Augmentation:** Uses data augmentation techniques to improve model accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Flask (for building a web-based UI, optional)

## Installation & Usage

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/khush9651/ComputerVisionforOutfitMatching-StyledGenie.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd ComputerVisionforOutfitMatching-StyledGenie

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the model training script
python train_model.py

# Use the model to predict outfit matches
python outfit_match.py --image <image-path>

# (Optional) Run the web interface
python app.py
```

```

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload images of clothing items.
2. **Classification:** The model categorizes the clothing items into predefined classes.
3. **Color Harmony Check:** The system identifies compatible color schemes.
4. **Outfit Suggestion:** The AI suggests matching outfits based on detected categories and colors.
5. **Report Generation:** Model performance and accuracy details are documented.
